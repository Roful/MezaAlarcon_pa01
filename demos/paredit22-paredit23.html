</span><span class='d'>;;; Paredit should run in GNU Emacs 21 or later and XEmacs 21.5 or
</span><span class='d'>;;; later.  Paredit is highly unlikely to work in earlier versions of
</span><span class='d'>;;; GNU Emacs, and it may have obscure problems in earlier versions of
</span><span class='d'>;;; XEmacs due to the way its syntax parser reports conditions, as a
</span><span class='d'>;;; result of which the code that uses the syntax parser must mask all
</span><span class='d'>;;; error conditions, not just those generated by the syntax parser.
</span><span class='d'>;;;
</span><span class='d'>;;; Questions, bug reports, comments, feature suggestions, &c., may be
</span><span class='d'>;;; addressed via email to the author&#39;s surname at mumble.net or via

</span><span class='d'>;;; channel.

</span><span class='d'>;;; Please contact the author rather than forking your own versions, to
</span><span class='d'>;;; prevent the dissemination of random variants floating about the
</span><span class='d'>;;; internet unbeknownst to the author.  Laziness is not an excuse:
</span><span class='d'>;;; your laziness costs me confusion and time trying to support
</span><span class='d'>;;; paredit, so if you fork paredit, you make the world a worse place.
</span><span class='d'>;;;
</span><span class='d'>;;; *** WARNING *** IMPORTANT *** DO NOT SUBMIT BUGS BEFORE READING ***
</span><span class='d'>;;;
</span><span class='d'>;;; If you plan to submit a bug report, where some sequence of keys in
</span><span class='d'>;;; Paredit Mode, or some sequence of paredit commands, doesn&#39;t do what
</span><span class='d'>;;; you wanted, then it is helpful to isolate an example in a very
</span><span class='d'>;;; small buffer, and it is **ABSOLUTELY**ESSENTIAL** that you supply,
</span><span class='d'>;;; along with the sequence of keys or commands,
</span><span class='d'>;;;
</span><span class='d'>;;;   (1) the version of Emacs,
</span><span class='d'>;;;   (2) the version of paredit.el[*], and
</span><span class='d'>;;;   (3) the **COMPLETE** state of the buffer used to reproduce the
</span><span class='d'>;;;       problem, including major mode, minor modes, local key
</span><span class='d'>;;;       bindings, entire contents of the buffer, leading line breaks
</span><span class='d'>;;;       or spaces, &c.
</span><span class='d'>;;;
</span><span class='d'>;;; It is often extremely difficult to reproduce problems, especially
</span><span class='d'>;;; with commands such as `paredit-kill&#39;.  If you do not supply **ALL**
</span><span class='d'>;;; of this information, then it is highly probable that I cannot
</span><span class='d'>;;; reproduce your problem no matter how hard I try, and the effect of
</span><span class='d'>;;; submitting a bug without this information is only to waste your
</span><span class='d'>;;; time and mine.  So, please, include all of the above information.
</span><a id='6831' tid='6832' class='u'>;;;
</a><span class='d'>;;; [*] If you are using a beta version of paredit, be sure that you
</span><span class='d'>;;;     are using the *latest* edition of the beta version, available
</span><span class='d'>;;;     at &lt;http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit-beta.el&gt;.  If you
</span><span class='d'>;;;     are not using a beta version, then upgrade either to that or to
</span><span class='d'>;;;     the latest release version; I cannot support older versions,
</span><span class='d'>;;;     and I can&#39;t fathom any reason why you might be using them.  So
</span><span class='d'>;;;     the answer to item (2) should be either `release&#39; or `beta&#39;.
