;;; Install paredit by placing `paredit.el' in `/path/to/elisp', a
;;; directory of your choice, and adding to your .emacs file:
;;;
;;;   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/elisp")
;;;   (autoload 'enable-paredit-mode "paredit"
;;;     "Turn on pseudo-structural editing of Lisp code."
;;;     t)
;;;
;;; Enable Paredit Mode on the fly with `M-x enable-paredit-mode RET',
;;; or always enable it in a major mode `M' (e.g., `lisp') with:
;;;
;;;   (add-hook M-mode-hook 'enable-paredit-mode)
;;;
;;; Customize paredit using `eval-after-load':
;;;
;;;   (eval-after-load 'paredit
;;;     '(progn ...redefine keys, &c....))
;;;
;;; Paredit should run in GNU Emacs 21 or later and XEmacs 21.5 or
;;; later.  Paredit is highly unlikely to work in earlier versions of
;;; GNU Emacs, and it may have obscure problems in earlier versions of
;;; XEmacs due to the way its syntax parser reports conditions, as a
;;; result of which the code that uses the syntax parser must mask all
;;; error conditions, not just those generated by the syntax parser.
;;;
;;; Questions, bug reports, comments, feature suggestions, &c., may be
;;; addressed via email to the author's surname at mumble.net or via
;;; IRC to the user named Riastradh on irc.freenode.net in the #paredit
;;; channel.
;;;
;;; Please contact the author rather than forking your own versions, to
;;; prevent the dissemination of random variants floating about the
;;; internet unbeknownst to the author.  Laziness is not an excuse:
;;; your laziness costs me confusion and time trying to support
;;; paredit, so if you fork paredit, you make the world a worse place.
;;;
;;; *** WARNING *** IMPORTANT *** DO NOT SUBMIT BUGS BEFORE READING ***
;;;
;;; If you plan to submit a bug report, where some sequence of keys in
;;; Paredit Mode, or some sequence of paredit commands, doesn't do what
;;; you wanted, then it is helpful to isolate an example in a very
;;; small buffer, and it is **ABSOLUTELY**ESSENTIAL** that you supply,
;;; along with the sequence of keys or commands,
;;;
;;;   (1) the version of Emacs,
;;;   (2) the version of paredit.el[*], and
;;;   (3) the **COMPLETE** state of the buffer used to reproduce the
;;;       problem, including major mode, minor modes, local key
;;;       bindings, entire contents of the buffer, leading line breaks
;;;       or spaces, &c.
;;;
;;; It is often extremely difficult to reproduce problems, especially
;;; with commands such as `paredit-kill'.  If you do not supply **ALL**
;;; of this information, then it is highly probable that I cannot
;;; reproduce your problem no matter how hard I try, and the effect of
;;; submitting a bug without this information is only to waste your
;;; time and mine.  So, please, include all of the above information.
;;;
;;; [*] If you are using a beta version of paredit, be sure that you
;;;     are using the *latest* edition of the beta version, available
;;;     at <http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit-beta.el>.  If you
;;;     are not using a beta version, then upgrade either to that or to
;;;     the latest release version; I cannot support older versions,
;;;     and I can't fathom any reason why you might be using them.  So
;;;     the answer to item (2) should be either `release' or `beta'.

;;; The paredit minor mode, Paredit Mode, binds a number of simple
;;; keys, notably `(', `)', `"', and `\', to commands that more
;;; carefully insert S-expression structures in the buffer.  The
;;; parenthesis delimiter keys (round or square) are defined to insert
;;; parenthesis pairs and move past the closing delimiter,
;;; respectively; the double-quote key is multiplexed to do both, and
;;; also to insert an escape if within a string; and backslashes prompt
;;; the user for the next character to input, because a lone backslash
;;; can break structure inadvertently.  These all have their ordinary
;;; behaviour when inside comments, and, outside comments, if truly
;;; necessary, you can insert them literally with `C-q'.
;;;
;;; The key bindings are designed so that when typing new code in
;;; Paredit Mode, you can generally use exactly the same keystrokes as
;;; you would have used without Paredit Mode.  Earlier versions of
;;; paredit.el did not conform to this, because Paredit Mode bound `)'
;;; to a command that would insert a newline.  Now `)' is bound to a
;;; command that does not insert a newline, and `M-)' is bound to the
;;; command that inserts a newline.  To revert to the former behaviour,
;;; add the following forms to an `eval-after-load' form for paredit.el
;;; in your .emacs file:
;;;
;;;   (define-key paredit-mode-map (kbd ")")
;;;     'paredit-close-round-and-newline)
;;;   (define-key paredit-mode-map (kbd "M-)")
;;;     'paredit-close-round)
;;;
;;; Paredit Mode also binds the usual keys for deleting and killing, so
;;; that they will not destroy any S-expression structure by killing or
;;; deleting only one side of a parenthesis or quote pair.  If the
;;; point is on a closing delimiter, `DEL' will move left over it; if
;;; it is on an opening delimiter, `C-d' will move right over it.  Only
;;; if the point is between a pair of delimiters will `C-d' or `DEL'
;;; delete them, and in that case it will delete both simultaneously.
;;; `M-d' and `M-DEL' kill words, but skip over any S-expression
;;; structure.  `C-k' kills from the start of the line, either to the
;;; line's end, if it contains only balanced expressions; to the first
;;; closing delimiter, if the point is within a form that ends on the
;;; line; or up to the end of the last expression that starts on the
;;; line after the point.
;;;
;;; The behaviour of the commands for deleting and killing can be
;;; overridden by passing a `C-u' prefix argument: `C-u DEL' will
;;; delete a character backward, `C-u C-d' will delete a character
;;; forward, and `C-u C-k' will kill text from the point to the end of
;;; the line, irrespective of the S-expression structure in the buffer.
;;; This can be used to fix mistakes in a buffer, but should generally
;;; be avoided.
;;;
;;; Paredit performs automatic reindentation as locally as possible, to
;;; avoid interfering with custom indentation used elsewhere in some
;;; S-expression.  Only the advanced S-expression manipulation commands
;;; automatically reindent, and only the forms that were immediately
;;; operated upon (and their subforms).
;;;
;;; This code is written for clarity, not efficiency.  It frequently
;;; walks over S-expressions redundantly.  If you have problems with
;;; the time it takes to execute some of the commands, let me know, but
;;; first be sure that what you're doing is reasonable: it is
;;; preferable to avoid immense S-expressions in code anyway.

;;; This assumes Unix-style LF line endings.
